# Algorithm Practice
24 practice algorithms. 

## Requirements
You need Deno for this. You can go install Deno at [their offical page](https://deno.com/), or just run the following command in PowerShell: `irm https://deno.land/install.ps1 | iex`

## Guide
Code your algorithms in each corresponding file in the `practice/` directory.
To test your algorithm, run in the terminal, `deno test tests/<testname>.ts`, where `<testname>` is the filename of the algorithm you are running, minus the number. So, if you want to test `1_linear_search.ts`, you should run `deno test tests/linear_search.ts`. Remember you can use `<Tab>` for a faster lookup in the terminal.
