// sort an array is useful in cases i guess
// an array is sorted so that any element i (arr[i]) is larger than arr[i - 1]
// bubble sort is a pretty easy method of implementing, even if it is not fast
// in bubble sort, we compare if a number is smaller than its previous
// if that is the case, we switch both of them 
// so that at the end of an iteration, the right part of the array is getting sorted

// sort the array with bubble sort
export default function bubble_sort(arr: number[]): void {
