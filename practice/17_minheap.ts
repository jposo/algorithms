// in a min heap, sometimes called priority queue, each node is smaller than or equal to its children
// the root is the smallest element in the structure
// min heap is usually represented as an array
// root element is arr[0]
// for an ith node arr[i]
// parent: arr[(i - 1) / 2]
// left child: arr[(2 * i) + 1]
// right child: arr[(2 * i) + 2]
// this is a hard algorithm to implement and explain, you can skip if you want to
// .. or watch a video or an article
